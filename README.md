##### Notes To Self
- If a nested structure is optional, a config should be set to allow that nested property to be or not to be generated



### Need to write - 
1. an object can lookup the values of a parent object for conditional statements / branches
2. you should be able to wrap any fn in a probability factor to determine one of multiple outcomes
